            <p>
              Coffeeroasters began its journey of exotic discovery
              <br />in 1999, highlighting stories of coffee from around
              <br />the world. We have since been dedicated to bring <br />the
              perfect cup - from bean to brew - in every <br />shipment.

              <p>
                We’re built on a simple mission and a commitment to doing good
                along the way. <br />We want to make it easy for you to discover
                and brew the world’s best coffee at <br />home. It all starts at
                the source. To locate the specific lots we want to purchase,
                <br />we travel nearly 60 days a year trying to understand the
                challenges and <br />initiatives, and invest in coffee plant
                science. Curating only the finest blends, we <br />roast each
                lot to highlight tasting profiles distinctive to their native
                growing <br />region.

                Although we work with growers who pay close attention to all
                stages of harvest <br />and processing, we employ, on our end, a
                rigorous quality control program to <br />avoid over-roasting or
                baking the coffee dry. Every bag of coffee is tagged with a
                <br />roast date and batch number. Our goal is to roast
                consistent, user-friendly <br />coffee, so that brewing is easy
                and enjoyable.
